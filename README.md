# AtomBlog.js

A simple blog using javascript to parse and display an atom feed

## Installation

Put the files in the project somewhere that will be served by a web
server.  Get version 1.9.1 of jQuery and put it in the root directory.
You can get this version of jQuery at the following URL:

http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js

## Usage

Open atom.xml in a text editor and add your own custom information.
Whenever you would like to create a new blog post, copy one of the
<entry> blogs and edit appropriately.  It's important that your blog
id is unique across all syndicated blogs so don't use the default but
use something you know won't be used by someone else.  If you have a
URL that nobody else blogs on, use that.  It's also important that
each entry id be unique within the scope of your blog.
